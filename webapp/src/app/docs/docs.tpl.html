<strong>Note that this is only a getting started guide, for more detailed information about the buid system, the available tasks, the configuration of the build or anything else, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/vesparny/ng-kickstart/#readme" target="_blank">documentation on the github project</a>.</strong>
</p>
<h3>What and Why</h3>
<p>

	<code>ng-kickstart</code> is an opinionated kickstart for single page application development in AngularJS 1.2 . It makes you development easy, keeps the structure of the project consistent and allows you to create a fully optimized production release whith a single grunt task.
	I decided to build this tool because of the lack of a build system that let me develop a single page application keeping an organized file structure, and in the meantime that allows me to develop on a index.html file generated at build time, tied to my real backend.
</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	I assume that you have <strong>Node.js and SASS</strong> installed.
	You also need <strong>karma and bower</strong>.
</p>

<pre><code>
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
</code></pre>

<p>
After that install <code>ng-kickstart</code>
</p>

<pre><code>
$ git clone git://github.com/vesparny/ng-kickstart yourProjectName
$ cd yourProjectName
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt serve
</code></pre>

<p>
You are now ready to go, your applcation is avalable at <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000</code>.
Every request to <code>/api</code> will be proxied to <code>http://127.0.0.1:9001/api</code>.
</p>
<p>
In the <strong>/backend/silex</strong> folder, you can find an example REST api written with Silex PHP micro-framework. Refer to the README.md present in that folder and launch the api.
Then go to <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000/notes</code>.

You are now ready to start coding, every file you add, edit or delete into the <strong>/webapp</strong> folder, will be handled by the build system.
</p>
<p>
When you are ready to build a production release there is a task for that.
</p>

<pre><code>
$ grunt dist
</code></pre>

<p>
After the task has finished you can find an optimized version of your project into the <strong>/build/dist</strong> folder.
