      <strong>Note that this is only a getting started guide, for more detailed information about the build system, the available tasks, the configuration of the build or anything else, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/vesparny/ng-kickstart/#readme" target="_blank">documentation</a> on the GitHub project.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>What and Why</h3>
    <p>
      <code>ng-kickstart</code> is an opinionated kickstart for single page application development in AngularJS 1.2. It makes your development easy, keeps the structure of the project consistent and allows you to create a fully optimized production release
      with a single grunt task. I decided to build this tool because of the lack of a build system that let me develop a single page application while keeping an organized file structure, and in the meantime that allows me to develop on a index.html file
      generated at build time, tied to my real backend.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>
      Install
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installation" target="_blank">node.js</a></strong>. Then
      <strong>sass, grunt-cli, karma and bower</strong> if you haven't yet.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    $ gem install sass
    $ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>
      After that, install
      <code>ng-kickstart</code> - download the <a href="https://github.com/vesparny/ng-kickstart/archive/v0.0.2.zip">latest</a> release (or clone the master branch if want to run the development version). Unzip the project and cd into it, then install
      bower and npm dependencies, and run the application in development mode.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt serve
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>
      You are now ready to go, your applcation is available at
      <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000</code>. Every request to
      <code>/api</code> will be proxied to
      <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/api</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the
      <strong>/backend</strong> folder, you can find two examples of RESTFul backend. One using <strong> Silex PHP micro-framework + SQLite</strong> and another using <strong>expressjs + MongoDB</strong>. Refer to the README.md into its folder to launch
      the desired backend (or run your own). Then go to
      <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes</code>. You are now ready to start coding, every file you add, edit or delete into the
      <strong>/webapp</strong> folder, will be handled by the build system.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to build a production release there is a task for that.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    $ grunt dist
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>
      After the task has finished you can find an optimized version of your project in the
      <strong>/build/dist</strong> folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also a task for execute unit tests located inside the <strong>/webapp/test</strong> folder.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    $ grunt unit
    </code>
</pre>
